## Overview

This project is a complete multi-page website for a fictional artistic workshop brand — built as an early frontend development exercise. The goal was to demonstrate structured multi-page site architecture, semantic HTML5 markup, CSS layout techniques, and page-to-page navigation. The site covers the typical surface area of a small creative business: a homepage, product catalog, workshops, contact, about, and login pages.

No JavaScript frameworks or CSS preprocessors are used — the entire site is authored in raw HTML and CSS, keeping the focus on frontend fundamentals.
